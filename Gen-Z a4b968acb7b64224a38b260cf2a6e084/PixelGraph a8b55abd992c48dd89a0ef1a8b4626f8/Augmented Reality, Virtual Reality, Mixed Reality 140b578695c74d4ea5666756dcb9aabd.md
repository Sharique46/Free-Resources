What's the difference between virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality?

The graphic above provides a quick visual summary of the differences.

In short, virtual reality puts the user in a fully artificial (or digital) environment. With augmented reality, the user can see digital objects overlaid on top of the real world. Mixed reality allows you to interact with those digital objects in the context of the real world. With AR and MR, those digital environments can be scaled down in size and viewed on a table top or be complete one-to-one scale experiences.
